Test that org-babel can even execute the code block and return the result:

#+begin_src root
printf("test\n");
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: test

This code block tests that a session with the correct name can be created

#+begin_src root :session testing
printf("test\n");
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: test

Here I am testing that one can create a code block that declares and applies a
function. In this we have many lines of statements.

#+begin_src root :session new-session
int testing(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

auto result = testing(1, 2);
printf("The result is %d\n", result);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: sult);
: The result is 3

Testing that values from one session do indeed carry onto the next code block. As
long as the spawned process is not closed in between, this should be a given.

#+begin_src root :session new-session
testing(1, 2)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (int) 3
